     Chapter 1\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in\\n&#39;, &#39;      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be\\n&#39;, &#39;      on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well\\n&#39;, &#39;      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is\\n&#39;, &#39;      considered the rightful property of some one or other of their\\n&#39;, &#39;      daughters.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you\\n&#39;, &#39;      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      she told me all about it.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet made no answer.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife\\n&#39;, &#39;      impatiently.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      This was invitation enough.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is\\n&#39;, &#39;      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;\\n&#39;, &#39;      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the\\n&#39;, &#39;      place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before\\n&#39;, &#39;      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by\\n&#39;, &#39;      the end of next week.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What is his name?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Bingley.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Is he married or single?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;\\n&#39;, &#39;      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “How so? How can it affect them?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\\n&#39;, &#39;      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\\n&#39;, &#39;      them.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Is that his design in settling here?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\\n&#39;, &#39;      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\n&#39;, &#39;      must visit him as soon as he comes.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\\n&#39;, &#39;      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\\n&#39;, &#39;      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you\\n&#39;, &#39;      the best of the party.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\\n&#39;, &#39;      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\n&#39;, &#39;      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\\n&#39;, &#39;      thinking of her own beauty.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\\n&#39;, &#39;      comes into the neighbourhood.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\\n&#39;, &#39;      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\\n&#39;, &#39;      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\\n&#39;, &#39;      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\\n&#39;, &#39;      impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\\n&#39;, &#39;      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\n&#39;, &#39;      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\n&#39;, &#39;      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\\n&#39;, &#39;      little Lizzy.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\\n&#39;, &#39;      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\n&#39;, &#39;      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\n&#39;, &#39;      giving _her_ the preference.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\n&#39;, &#39;      something more of quickness than her sisters.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\\n&#39;, &#39;      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor\\n&#39;, &#39;      nerves.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\\n&#39;, &#39;      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\\n&#39;, &#39;      consideration these last twenty years at least.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\\n&#39;, &#39;      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\\n&#39;, &#39;      will not visit them.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\\n&#39;, &#39;      visit them all.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\n&#39;, &#39;      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\\n&#39;, &#39;      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\\n&#39;, &#39;      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\\n&#39;, &#39;      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\\n&#39;, &#39;      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\\n&#39;, &#39;      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\\n&#39;, &#39;      solace was visiting and news.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 2\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\n&#39;, &#39;      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\n&#39;, &#39;      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\\n&#39;, &#39;      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\\n&#39;, &#39;      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\\n&#39;, &#39;      with:\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\\n&#39;, &#39;      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\\n&#39;, &#39;      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\\n&#39;, &#39;      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\n&#39;, &#39;      have no opinion of her.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\\n&#39;, &#39;      you do not depend on her serving you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\\n&#39;, &#39;      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little\\n&#39;, &#39;      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\\n&#39;, &#39;      times them ill.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\\n&#39;, &#39;      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “To-morrow fortnight.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\\n&#39;, &#39;      back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\n&#39;, &#39;      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\n&#39;, &#39;      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is\\n&#39;, &#39;      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\\n&#39;, &#39;      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\\n&#39;, &#39;      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\\n&#39;, &#39;      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\\n&#39;, &#39;      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Nonsense, nonsense!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\\n&#39;, &#39;      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\\n&#39;, &#39;      _there_. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep\\n&#39;, &#39;      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\\n&#39;, &#39;      to Mr. Bingley.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that\\n&#39;, &#39;      before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not\\n&#39;, &#39;      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\n&#39;, &#39;      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\n&#39;, &#39;      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\n&#39;, &#39;      had expected all the while.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\n&#39;, &#39;      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\n&#39;, &#39;      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\n&#39;, &#39;      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and\\n&#39;, &#39;      never said a word about it till now.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\n&#39;, &#39;      raptures of his wife.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the\\n&#39;, &#39;      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends\\n&#39;, &#39;      for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of\\n&#39;, &#39;      life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\n&#39;, &#39;      acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\n&#39;, &#39;      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\\n&#39;, &#39;      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\n&#39;, &#39;      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\n&#39;, &#39;      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\\n&#39;, &#39;      ask him to dinner.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 3\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\n&#39;, &#39;      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\n&#39;, &#39;      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\n&#39;, &#39;      They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions,\\n&#39;, &#39;      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\n&#39;, &#39;      skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\n&#39;, &#39;      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\\n&#39;, &#39;      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\\n&#39;, &#39;      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\n&#39;, &#39;      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\\n&#39;, &#39;      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\\n&#39;, &#39;      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\\n&#39;, &#39;      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\n&#39;, &#39;      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\\n&#39;, &#39;      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\\n&#39;, &#39;      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\\n&#39;, &#39;      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\\n&#39;, &#39;      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\\n&#39;, &#39;      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\\n&#39;, &#39;      ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      rode a black horse.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\n&#39;, &#39;      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\n&#39;, &#39;      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\\n&#39;, &#39;      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their\\n&#39;, &#39;      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\\n&#39;, &#39;      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\\n&#39;, &#39;      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\\n&#39;, &#39;      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\n&#39;, &#39;      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\n&#39;, &#39;      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\\n&#39;, &#39;      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\\n&#39;, &#39;      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\\n&#39;, &#39;      ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\\n&#39;, &#39;      that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from\\n&#39;, &#39;      London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\\n&#39;, &#39;      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\\n&#39;, &#39;      young man.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\n&#39;, &#39;      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\\n&#39;, &#39;      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\\n&#39;, &#39;      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\\n&#39;, &#39;      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\\n&#39;, &#39;      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\\n&#39;, &#39;      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\\n&#39;, &#39;      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\n&#39;, &#39;      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\\n&#39;, &#39;      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to\\n&#39;, &#39;      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\n&#39;, &#39;      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\n&#39;, &#39;      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\\n&#39;, &#39;      compared with his friend.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\n&#39;, &#39;      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\n&#39;, &#39;      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\\n&#39;, &#39;      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\\n&#39;, &#39;      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\\n&#39;, &#39;      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\n&#39;, &#39;      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\\n&#39;, &#39;      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\\n&#39;, &#39;      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\n&#39;, &#39;      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\\n&#39;, &#39;      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\\n&#39;, &#39;      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\\n&#39;, &#39;      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\n&#39;, &#39;      daughters.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\\n&#39;, &#39;      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a\\n&#39;, &#39;      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\\n&#39;, &#39;      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\n&#39;, &#39;      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\\n&#39;, &#39;      better dance.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\n&#39;, &#39;      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\\n&#39;, &#39;      this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\n&#39;, &#39;      punishment to me to stand up with.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley,\\n&#39;, &#39;      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\\n&#39;, &#39;      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\\n&#39;, &#39;      them you see uncommonly pretty.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\\n&#39;, &#39;      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\\n&#39;, &#39;      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\\n&#39;, &#39;      to introduce you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\\n&#39;, &#39;      said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I\\n&#39;, &#39;      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\\n&#39;, &#39;      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\\n&#39;, &#39;      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\\n&#39;, &#39;      me.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She\\n&#39;, &#39;      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\\n&#39;, &#39;      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\\n&#39;, &#39;      anything ridiculous.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\\n&#39;, &#39;      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\\n&#39;, &#39;      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\\n&#39;, &#39;      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\\n&#39;, &#39;      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\n&#39;, &#39;      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\\n&#39;, &#39;      never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet\\n&#39;, &#39;      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\n&#39;, &#39;      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\\n&#39;, &#39;      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\\n&#39;, &#39;      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\\n&#39;, &#39;      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\\n&#39;, &#39;      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\\n&#39;, &#39;      rather hoped that his wife’s views on the stranger would be\\n&#39;, &#39;      disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story\\n&#39;, &#39;      to hear.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\\n&#39;, &#39;      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\\n&#39;, &#39;      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\\n&#39;, &#39;      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of _that_,\\n&#39;, &#39;      my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only\\n&#39;, &#39;      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\\n&#39;, &#39;      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!\\n&#39;, &#39;      But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\\n&#39;, &#39;      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\n&#39;, &#39;      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with\\n&#39;, &#39;      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\\n&#39;, &#39;      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\\n&#39;, &#39;      _Boulanger_—”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\\n&#39;, &#39;      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\\n&#39;, &#39;      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\\n&#39;, &#39;      ankle in the first dance!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\n&#39;, &#39;      handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\\n&#39;, &#39;      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\\n&#39;, &#39;      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\n&#39;, &#39;      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\\n&#39;, &#39;      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\\n&#39;, &#39;      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\\n&#39;, &#39;      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\\n&#39;, &#39;      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\\n&#39;, &#39;      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\\n&#39;, &#39;      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\\n&#39;, &#39;      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\\n&#39;, &#39;      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 4\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\n&#39;, &#39;      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\n&#39;, &#39;      sister just how very much she admired him.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\n&#39;, &#39;      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\\n&#39;, &#39;      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\\n&#39;, &#39;      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\\n&#39;, &#39;      thereby complete.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\n&#39;, &#39;      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\\n&#39;, &#39;      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\\n&#39;, &#39;      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\\n&#39;, &#39;      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\\n&#39;, &#39;      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\\n&#39;, &#39;      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\\n&#39;, &#39;      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Dear Lizzy!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\n&#39;, &#39;      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\\n&#39;, &#39;      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\\n&#39;, &#39;      human being in your life.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\n&#39;, &#39;      speak what I think.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\\n&#39;, &#39;      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\n&#39;, &#39;      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one\\n&#39;, &#39;      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\\n&#39;, &#39;      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it\\n&#39;, &#39;      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.\\n&#39;, &#39;      And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners\\n&#39;, &#39;      are not equal to his.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when\\n&#39;, &#39;      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a\\n&#39;, &#39;      very charming neighbour in her.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\n&#39;, &#39;      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\n&#39;, &#39;      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\n&#39;, &#39;      of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\n&#39;, &#39;      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\n&#39;, &#39;      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\n&#39;, &#39;      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\n&#39;, &#39;      themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.\\n&#39;, &#39;      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first\\n&#39;, &#39;      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\n&#39;, &#39;      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every\\n&#39;, &#39;      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of\\n&#39;, &#39;      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of\\n&#39;, &#39;      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\n&#39;, &#39;      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired\\n&#39;, &#39;      by trade.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\n&#39;, &#39;      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\n&#39;, &#39;      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it\\n&#39;, &#39;      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was\\n&#39;, &#39;      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was\\n&#39;, &#39;      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his\\n&#39;, &#39;      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at\\n&#39;, &#39;      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own;\\n&#39;, &#39;      but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\n&#39;, &#39;      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\n&#39;, &#39;      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by\\n&#39;, &#39;      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did\\n&#39;, &#39;      look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the\\n&#39;, &#39;      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner\\n&#39;, &#39;      said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\n&#39;, &#39;      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to\\n&#39;, &#39;      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\n&#39;, &#39;      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the\\n&#39;, &#39;      strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was\\n&#39;, &#39;      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was\\n&#39;, &#39;      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\n&#39;, &#39;      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was\\n&#39;, &#39;      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\n&#39;, &#39;      giving offense.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\n&#39;, &#39;      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more\\n&#39;, &#39;      pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\n&#39;, &#39;      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\n&#39;, &#39;      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\n&#39;, &#39;      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\n&#39;, &#39;      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\n&#39;, &#39;      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either\\n&#39;, &#39;      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\n&#39;, &#39;      but she smiled too much.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they\\n&#39;, &#39;      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet\\n&#39;, &#39;      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt\\n&#39;, &#39;      authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 5\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been\\n&#39;, &#39;      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable\\n&#39;, &#39;      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to\\n&#39;, &#39;      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been\\n&#39;, &#39;      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting\\n&#39;, &#39;      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile\\n&#39;, &#39;      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\n&#39;, &#39;      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled\\n&#39;, &#39;      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the\\n&#39;, &#39;      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\n&#39;, &#39;      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\n&#39;, &#39;      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation\\n&#39;, &#39;      at St. James’s had made him courteous.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\n&#39;, &#39;      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The\\n&#39;, &#39;      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about\\n&#39;, &#39;      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\\n&#39;, &#39;      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the\\n&#39;, &#39;      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\n&#39;, &#39;      communicate.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with\\n&#39;, &#39;      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first\\n&#39;, &#39;      choice.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\\n&#39;, &#39;      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather\\n&#39;, &#39;      believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know\\n&#39;, &#39;      what—something about Mr. Robinson.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\\n&#39;, &#39;      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\\n&#39;, &#39;      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\\n&#39;, &#39;      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he\\n&#39;, &#39;      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\\n&#39;, &#39;      question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there\\n&#39;, &#39;      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem\\n&#39;, &#39;      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”\\n&#39;, &#39;      said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as\\n&#39;, &#39;      his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\n&#39;, &#39;      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would\\n&#39;, &#39;      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last\\n&#39;, &#39;      night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once\\n&#39;, &#39;      opening his lips.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said\\n&#39;, &#39;      Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite\\n&#39;, &#39;      angry at being spoke to.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,\\n&#39;, &#39;      unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is\\n&#39;, &#39;      remarkably agreeable.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\n&#39;, &#39;      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how\\n&#39;, &#39;      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare\\n&#39;, &#39;      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,\\n&#39;, &#39;      “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with\\n&#39;, &#39;      _him_, if I were you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with\\n&#39;, &#39;      him.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as\\n&#39;, &#39;      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot\\n&#39;, &#39;      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\n&#39;, &#39;      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I\\n&#39;, &#39;      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily\\n&#39;, &#39;      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of\\n&#39;, &#39;      her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\n&#39;, &#39;      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\n&#39;, &#39;      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\n&#39;, &#39;      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\n&#39;, &#39;      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\n&#39;, &#39;      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\n&#39;, &#39;      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without\\n&#39;, &#39;      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,\\n&#39;, &#39;      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came\\n&#39;, &#39;      with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would\\n&#39;, &#39;      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\n&#39;, &#39;      your bottle directly.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\n&#39;, &#39;      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 6\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The\\n&#39;, &#39;      visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing\\n&#39;, &#39;      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and\\n&#39;, &#39;      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger\\n&#39;, &#39;      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted\\n&#39;, &#39;      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this\\n&#39;, &#39;      attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth\\n&#39;, &#39;      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,\\n&#39;, &#39;      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though\\n&#39;, &#39;      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\n&#39;, &#39;      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.\\n&#39;, &#39;      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire\\n&#39;, &#39;      her and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to\\n&#39;, &#39;      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the\\n&#39;, &#39;      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she\\n&#39;, &#39;      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered\\n&#39;, &#39;      by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength\\n&#39;, &#39;      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of\\n&#39;, &#39;      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the\\n&#39;, &#39;      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to\\n&#39;, &#39;      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\n&#39;, &#39;      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\\n&#39;, &#39;      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\n&#39;, &#39;      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\n&#39;, &#39;      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\\n&#39;, &#39;      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it\\n&#39;, &#39;      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a\\n&#39;, &#39;      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\n&#39;, &#39;      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\n&#39;, &#39;      In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection\\n&#39;, &#39;      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may\\n&#39;, &#39;      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If\\n&#39;, &#39;      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\n&#39;, &#39;      indeed, not to discover it too.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you\\n&#39;, &#39;      do.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\n&#39;, &#39;      conceal it, he must find it out.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley\\n&#39;, &#39;      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours\\n&#39;, &#39;      together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed\\n&#39;, &#39;      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in\\n&#39;, &#39;      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every\\n&#39;, &#39;      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is\\n&#39;, &#39;      secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as\\n&#39;, &#39;      much as she chooses.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is\\n&#39;, &#39;      in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\n&#39;, &#39;      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\n&#39;, &#39;      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not\\n&#39;, &#39;      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\n&#39;, &#39;      degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known\\n&#39;, &#39;      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;\\n&#39;, &#39;      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined\\n&#39;, &#39;      with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make\\n&#39;, &#39;      her understand his character.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she\\n&#39;, &#39;      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\n&#39;, &#39;      you must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\n&#39;, &#39;      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\n&#39;, &#39;      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to\\n&#39;, &#39;      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has\\n&#39;, &#39;      been unfolded.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\n&#39;, &#39;      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had\\n&#39;, &#39;      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his\\n&#39;, &#39;      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\\n&#39;, &#39;      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\\n&#39;, &#39;      well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does\\n&#39;, &#39;      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\\n&#39;, &#39;      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\\n&#39;, &#39;      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\\n&#39;, &#39;      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\\n&#39;, &#39;      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\n&#39;, &#39;      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\\n&#39;, &#39;      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\n&#39;, &#39;      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\n&#39;, &#39;      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\\n&#39;, &#39;      clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good\\n&#39;, &#39;      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\n&#39;, &#39;      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\\n&#39;, &#39;      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\\n&#39;, &#39;      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\\n&#39;, &#39;      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\\n&#39;, &#39;      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\\n&#39;, &#39;      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\\n&#39;, &#39;      unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\\n&#39;, &#39;      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\n&#39;, &#39;      with.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\n&#39;, &#39;      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\n&#39;, &#39;      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\\n&#39;, &#39;      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\\n&#39;, &#39;      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\n&#39;, &#39;      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\\n&#39;, &#39;      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\\n&#39;, &#39;      of him.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\\n&#39;, &#39;      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\\n&#39;, &#39;      to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\n&#39;, &#39;      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\\n&#39;, &#39;      ball at Meryton?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\n&#39;, &#39;      energetic.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You are severe on us.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\\n&#39;, &#39;      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\\n&#39;, &#39;      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\\n&#39;, &#39;      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\\n&#39;, &#39;      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\\n&#39;, &#39;      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\\n&#39;, &#39;      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well, if it\\n&#39;, &#39;      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\\n&#39;, &#39;      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\\n&#39;, &#39;      with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I shall keep\\n&#39;, &#39;      mine to swell my song.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\\n&#39;, &#39;      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\\n&#39;, &#39;      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\\n&#39;, &#39;      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\\n&#39;, &#39;      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\\n&#39;, &#39;      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\n&#39;, &#39;      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\n&#39;, &#39;      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\n&#39;, &#39;      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\n&#39;, &#39;      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\\n&#39;, &#39;      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\\n&#39;, &#39;      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\\n&#39;, &#39;      request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\\n&#39;, &#39;      of the room.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\n&#39;, &#39;      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\n&#39;, &#39;      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\\n&#39;, &#39;      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\\n&#39;, &#39;      the first refinements of polished society.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\n&#39;, &#39;\n*** WARNING: skipped 798621 bytes of output ***\n\n\n</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">[&#39;\\ufeffThe Project Gutenberg eBook of Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\\n&#39;, &#39;most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\\n&#39;, &#39;whatsoever.

     Chapter 1\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in\\n&#39;, &#39;      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be\\n&#39;, &#39;      on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well\\n&#39;, &#39;      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is\\n&#39;, &#39;      considered the rightful property of some one or other of their\\n&#39;, &#39;      daughters.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you\\n&#39;, &#39;      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      she told me all about it.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet made no answer.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife\\n&#39;, &#39;      impatiently.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      This was invitation enough.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is\\n&#39;, &#39;      taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;\\n&#39;, &#39;      that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the\\n&#39;, &#39;      place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before\\n&#39;, &#39;      Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by\\n&#39;, &#39;      the end of next week.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What is his name?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Bingley.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Is he married or single?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;\\n&#39;, &#39;      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “How so? How can it affect them?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so\\n&#39;, &#39;      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of\\n&#39;, &#39;      them.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Is that his design in settling here?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely\\n&#39;, &#39;      that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you\\n&#39;, &#39;      must visit him as soon as he comes.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may\\n&#39;, &#39;      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for\\n&#39;, &#39;      as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you\\n&#39;, &#39;      the best of the party.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of\\n&#39;, &#39;      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.\\n&#39;, &#39;      When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over\\n&#39;, &#39;      thinking of her own beauty.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he\\n&#39;, &#39;      comes into the neighbourhood.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it\\n&#39;, &#39;      would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are\\n&#39;, &#39;      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you\\n&#39;, &#39;      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be\\n&#39;, &#39;      impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be\\n&#39;, &#39;      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to\\n&#39;, &#39;      assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he\\n&#39;, &#39;      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my\\n&#39;, &#39;      little Lizzy.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better\\n&#39;, &#39;      than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as\\n&#39;, &#39;      Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always\\n&#39;, &#39;      giving _her_ the preference.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has\\n&#39;, &#39;      something more of quickness than her sisters.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?\\n&#39;, &#39;      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor\\n&#39;, &#39;      nerves.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.\\n&#39;, &#39;      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with\\n&#39;, &#39;      consideration these last twenty years at least.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men\\n&#39;, &#39;      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you\\n&#39;, &#39;      will not visit them.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will\\n&#39;, &#39;      visit them all.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\\n&#39;, &#39;      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty\\n&#39;, &#39;      years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his\\n&#39;, &#39;      character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a\\n&#39;, &#39;      woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain\\n&#39;, &#39;      temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous.\\n&#39;, &#39;      The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its\\n&#39;, &#39;      solace was visiting and news.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 2\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last\\n&#39;, &#39;      always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the\\n&#39;, &#39;      evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It\\n&#39;, &#39;      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second\\n&#39;, &#39;      daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her\\n&#39;, &#39;      with:\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her\\n&#39;, &#39;      mother resentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him\\n&#39;, &#39;      at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two\\n&#39;, &#39;      nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I\\n&#39;, &#39;      have no opinion of her.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that\\n&#39;, &#39;      you do not depend on her serving you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain\\n&#39;, &#39;      herself, began scolding one of her daughters.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little\\n&#39;, &#39;      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she\\n&#39;, &#39;      times them ill.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully.\\n&#39;, &#39;      “When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “To-morrow fortnight.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come\\n&#39;, &#39;      back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to\\n&#39;, &#39;      introduce him, for she will not know him herself.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      introduce Mr. Bingley to _her_.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted\\n&#39;, &#39;      with him myself; how can you be so teasing?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is\\n&#39;, &#39;      certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by\\n&#39;, &#39;      the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else\\n&#39;, &#39;      will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their\\n&#39;, &#39;      chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness,\\n&#39;, &#39;      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Nonsense, nonsense!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he.\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that\\n&#39;, &#39;      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you\\n&#39;, &#39;      _there_. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep\\n&#39;, &#39;      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return\\n&#39;, &#39;      to Mr. Bingley.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that\\n&#39;, &#39;      before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not\\n&#39;, &#39;      have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually\\n&#39;, &#39;      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first\\n&#39;, &#39;      tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she\\n&#39;, &#39;      had expected all the while.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\\n&#39;, &#39;      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\\n&#39;, &#39;      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is\\n&#39;, &#39;      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and\\n&#39;, &#39;      never said a word about it till now.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the\\n&#39;, &#39;      raptures of his wife.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the\\n&#39;, &#39;      door was shut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends\\n&#39;, &#39;      for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of\\n&#39;, &#39;      life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new\\n&#39;, &#39;      acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do\\n&#39;, &#39;      anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare\\n&#39;, &#39;      say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\\n&#39;, &#39;      youngest, I’m the tallest.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he\\n&#39;, &#39;      would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should\\n&#39;, &#39;      ask him to dinner.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 3\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her\\n&#39;, &#39;      five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw\\n&#39;, &#39;      from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.\\n&#39;, &#39;      They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions,\\n&#39;, &#39;      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the\\n&#39;, &#39;      skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the\\n&#39;, &#39;      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her\\n&#39;, &#39;      report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with\\n&#39;, &#39;      him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\\n&#39;, &#39;      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next\\n&#39;, &#39;      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To\\n&#39;, &#39;      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;\\n&#39;, &#39;      and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at\\n&#39;, &#39;      Netherfield,” said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the\\n&#39;, &#39;      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat\\n&#39;, &#39;      about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained\\n&#39;, &#39;      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose\\n&#39;, &#39;      beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies\\n&#39;, &#39;      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of\\n&#39;, &#39;      ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      rode a black horse.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and\\n&#39;, &#39;      already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do\\n&#39;, &#39;      credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred\\n&#39;, &#39;      it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their\\n&#39;, &#39;      invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could\\n&#39;, &#39;      not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his\\n&#39;, &#39;      arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be\\n&#39;, &#39;      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled\\n&#39;, &#39;      at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\\n&#39;, &#39;      little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to\\n&#39;, &#39;      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with\\n&#39;, &#39;      him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of\\n&#39;, &#39;      ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,\\n&#39;, &#39;      that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from\\n&#39;, &#39;      London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered\\n&#39;, &#39;      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another\\n&#39;, &#39;      young man.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\n&#39;, &#39;      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine\\n&#39;, &#39;      women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon\\n&#39;, &#39;      drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome\\n&#39;, &#39;      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general\\n&#39;, &#39;      circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having\\n&#39;, &#39;      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine\\n&#39;, &#39;      figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about\\n&#39;, &#39;      half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned\\n&#39;, &#39;      the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to\\n&#39;, &#39;      be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\\n&#39;, &#39;      large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\n&#39;, &#39;      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be\\n&#39;, &#39;      compared with his friend.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the\\n&#39;, &#39;      principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved,\\n&#39;, &#39;      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable\\n&#39;, &#39;      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him\\n&#39;, &#39;      and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and\\n&#39;, &#39;      once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other\\n&#39;, &#39;      lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the\\n&#39;, &#39;      room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His\\n&#39;, &#39;      character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\n&#39;, &#39;      in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there\\n&#39;, &#39;      again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet,\\n&#39;, &#39;      whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into\\n&#39;, &#39;      particular resentment by his having slighted one of her\\n&#39;, &#39;      daughters.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,\\n&#39;, &#39;      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a\\n&#39;, &#39;      conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance\\n&#39;, &#39;      for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you\\n&#39;, &#39;      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much\\n&#39;, &#39;      better dance.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\\n&#39;, &#39;      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as\\n&#39;, &#39;      this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a\\n&#39;, &#39;      punishment to me to stand up with.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley,\\n&#39;, &#39;      “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant\\n&#39;, &#39;      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of\\n&#39;, &#39;      them you see uncommonly pretty.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there\\n&#39;, &#39;      is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very\\n&#39;, &#39;      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner\\n&#39;, &#39;      to introduce you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly\\n&#39;, &#39;      said: “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I\\n&#39;, &#39;      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies\\n&#39;, &#39;      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your\\n&#39;, &#39;      partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with\\n&#39;, &#39;      me.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She\\n&#39;, &#39;      told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for\\n&#39;, &#39;      she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in\\n&#39;, &#39;      anything ridiculous.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the\\n&#39;, &#39;      Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she\\n&#39;, &#39;      had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified\\n&#39;, &#39;      by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned\\n&#39;, &#39;      to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the\\n&#39;, &#39;      neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough\\n&#39;, &#39;      never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet\\n&#39;, &#39;      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\\n&#39;, &#39;      spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which\\n&#39;, &#39;      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still\\n&#39;, &#39;      up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present\\n&#39;, &#39;      occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an\\n&#39;, &#39;      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had\\n&#39;, &#39;      rather hoped that his wife’s views on the stranger would be\\n&#39;, &#39;      disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story\\n&#39;, &#39;      to hear.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a\\n&#39;, &#39;      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had\\n&#39;, &#39;      been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her\\n&#39;, &#39;      quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of _that_,\\n&#39;, &#39;      my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only\\n&#39;, &#39;      creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all,\\n&#39;, &#39;      he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her!\\n&#39;, &#39;      But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can,\\n&#39;, &#39;      you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\n&#39;, &#39;      down the dance. So he enquired who she was, and got introduced,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with\\n&#39;, &#39;      Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth\\n&#39;, &#39;      with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the\\n&#39;, &#39;      _Boulanger_—”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband\\n&#39;, &#39;      impatiently, “he would not have danced half so much! For God’s\\n&#39;, &#39;      sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his\\n&#39;, &#39;      ankle in the first dance!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\\n&#39;, &#39;      handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life\\n&#39;, &#39;      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace\\n&#39;, &#39;      upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\\n&#39;, &#39;      description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another\\n&#39;, &#39;      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of\\n&#39;, &#39;      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much\\n&#39;, &#39;      by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid\\n&#39;, &#39;      man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that\\n&#39;, &#39;      there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there,\\n&#39;, &#39;      fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance\\n&#39;, &#39;      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one\\n&#39;, &#39;      of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 4\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been\\n&#39;, &#39;      cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her\\n&#39;, &#39;      sister just how very much she admired him.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,\\n&#39;, &#39;      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so\\n&#39;, &#39;      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man\\n&#39;, &#39;      ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is\\n&#39;, &#39;      thereby complete.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second\\n&#39;, &#39;      time. I did not expect such a compliment.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference\\n&#39;, &#39;      between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_\\n&#39;, &#39;      never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He\\n&#39;, &#39;      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as\\n&#39;, &#39;      every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for\\n&#39;, &#39;      that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave\\n&#39;, &#39;      to like him. You have liked many a stupider person.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Dear Lizzy!”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in\\n&#39;, &#39;      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good\\n&#39;, &#39;      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a\\n&#39;, &#39;      human being in your life.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always\\n&#39;, &#39;      speak what I think.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With\\n&#39;, &#39;      _your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and\\n&#39;, &#39;      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one\\n&#39;, &#39;      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or\\n&#39;, &#39;      design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it\\n&#39;, &#39;      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.\\n&#39;, &#39;      And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners\\n&#39;, &#39;      are not equal to his.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when\\n&#39;, &#39;      you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a\\n&#39;, &#39;      very charming neighbour in her.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their\\n&#39;, &#39;      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in\\n&#39;, &#39;      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy\\n&#39;, &#39;      of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by\\n&#39;, &#39;      any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve\\n&#39;, &#39;      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good\\n&#39;, &#39;      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making\\n&#39;, &#39;      themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.\\n&#39;, &#39;      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first\\n&#39;, &#39;      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\n&#39;, &#39;      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every\\n&#39;, &#39;      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of\\n&#39;, &#39;      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of\\n&#39;, &#39;      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories\\n&#39;, &#39;      than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired\\n&#39;, &#39;      by trade.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\\n&#39;, &#39;      thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an\\n&#39;, &#39;      estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it\\n&#39;, &#39;      likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was\\n&#39;, &#39;      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was\\n&#39;, &#39;      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his\\n&#39;, &#39;      temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at\\n&#39;, &#39;      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own;\\n&#39;, &#39;      but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley\\n&#39;, &#39;      was by no means unwilling to preside at his table—nor was Mrs.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less\\n&#39;, &#39;      disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by\\n&#39;, &#39;      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did\\n&#39;, &#39;      look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the\\n&#39;, &#39;      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner\\n&#39;, &#39;      said in its praise, and took it immediately.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in\\n&#39;, &#39;      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to\\n&#39;, &#39;      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper,\\n&#39;, &#39;      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the\\n&#39;, &#39;      strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was\\n&#39;, &#39;      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was\\n&#39;, &#39;      clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.\\n&#39;, &#39;      In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was\\n&#39;, &#39;      sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually\\n&#39;, &#39;      giving offense.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was\\n&#39;, &#39;      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more\\n&#39;, &#39;      pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been\\n&#39;, &#39;      most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no\\n&#39;, &#39;      stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as\\n&#39;, &#39;      to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom\\n&#39;, &#39;      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\\n&#39;, &#39;      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either\\n&#39;, &#39;      attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\\n&#39;, &#39;      but she smiled too much.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they\\n&#39;, &#39;      admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet\\n&#39;, &#39;      was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt\\n&#39;, &#39;      authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 5\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the\\n&#39;, &#39;      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been\\n&#39;, &#39;      formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable\\n&#39;, &#39;      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to\\n&#39;, &#39;      the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been\\n&#39;, &#39;      felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting\\n&#39;, &#39;      them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile\\n&#39;, &#39;      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he\\n&#39;, &#39;      could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled\\n&#39;, &#39;      by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the\\n&#39;, &#39;      world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\\n&#39;, &#39;      supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody.\\n&#39;, &#39;      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation\\n&#39;, &#39;      at St. James’s had made him courteous.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\\n&#39;, &#39;      valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The\\n&#39;, &#39;      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about\\n&#39;, &#39;      twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk\\n&#39;, &#39;      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the\\n&#39;, &#39;      assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to\\n&#39;, &#39;      communicate.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with\\n&#39;, &#39;      civil self-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first\\n&#39;, &#39;      choice.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.\\n&#39;, &#39;      To be sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather\\n&#39;, &#39;      believe he _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know\\n&#39;, &#39;      what—something about Mr. Robinson.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson;\\n&#39;, &#39;      did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he\\n&#39;, &#39;      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there\\n&#39;, &#39;      were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he\\n&#39;, &#39;      thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last\\n&#39;, &#39;      question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there\\n&#39;, &#39;      cannot be two opinions on that point.’”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem\\n&#39;, &#39;      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,”\\n&#39;, &#39;      said Charlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as\\n&#39;, &#39;      his friend, is he?—poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his\\n&#39;, &#39;      ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would\\n&#39;, &#39;      be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last\\n&#39;, &#39;      night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once\\n&#39;, &#39;      opening his lips.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?” said\\n&#39;, &#39;      Jane. “I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite\\n&#39;, &#39;      angry at being spoke to.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,\\n&#39;, &#39;      unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is\\n&#39;, &#39;      remarkably agreeable.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\\n&#39;, &#39;      agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how\\n&#39;, &#39;      it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare\\n&#39;, &#39;      say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas,\\n&#39;, &#39;      “but I wish he had danced with Eliza.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with\\n&#39;, &#39;      _him_, if I were you.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with\\n&#39;, &#39;      him.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as\\n&#39;, &#39;      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot\\n&#39;, &#39;      wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,\\n&#39;, &#39;      everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I\\n&#39;, &#39;      may so express it, he has a _right_ to be proud.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily\\n&#39;, &#39;      forgive _his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of\\n&#39;, &#39;      her reflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all\\n&#39;, &#39;      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common\\n&#39;, &#39;      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that\\n&#39;, &#39;      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of\\n&#39;, &#39;      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or\\n&#39;, &#39;      imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the\\n&#39;, &#39;      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without\\n&#39;, &#39;      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,\\n&#39;, &#39;      vanity to what we would have others think of us.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came\\n&#39;, &#39;      with his sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would\\n&#39;, &#39;      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mrs. Bennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away\\n&#39;, &#39;      your bottle directly.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare\\n&#39;, &#39;      that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Chapter 6\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The\\n&#39;, &#39;      visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing\\n&#39;, &#39;      manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and\\n&#39;, &#39;      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger\\n&#39;, &#39;      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted\\n&#39;, &#39;      with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this\\n&#39;, &#39;      attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth\\n&#39;, &#39;      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,\\n&#39;, &#39;      hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though\\n&#39;, &#39;      their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\\n&#39;, &#39;      all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.\\n&#39;, &#39;      It was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire\\n&#39;, &#39;      her and to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to\\n&#39;, &#39;      the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the\\n&#39;, &#39;      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she\\n&#39;, &#39;      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered\\n&#39;, &#39;      by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength\\n&#39;, &#39;      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of\\n&#39;, &#39;      manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the\\n&#39;, &#39;      impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to\\n&#39;, &#39;      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a\\n&#39;, &#39;      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her\\n&#39;, &#39;      affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose\\n&#39;, &#39;      the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor\\n&#39;, &#39;      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so\\n&#39;, &#39;      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it\\n&#39;, &#39;      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a\\n&#39;, &#39;      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us\\n&#39;, &#39;      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.\\n&#39;, &#39;      In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection\\n&#39;, &#39;      than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may\\n&#39;, &#39;      never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If\\n&#39;, &#39;      _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton,\\n&#39;, &#39;      indeed, not to discover it too.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you\\n&#39;, &#39;      do.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to\\n&#39;, &#39;      conceal it, he must find it out.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley\\n&#39;, &#39;      and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours\\n&#39;, &#39;      together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed\\n&#39;, &#39;      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in\\n&#39;, &#39;      conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every\\n&#39;, &#39;      half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is\\n&#39;, &#39;      secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as\\n&#39;, &#39;      much as she chooses.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is\\n&#39;, &#39;      in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were\\n&#39;, &#39;      determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I\\n&#39;, &#39;      should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not\\n&#39;, &#39;      acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the\\n&#39;, &#39;      degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known\\n&#39;, &#39;      him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton;\\n&#39;, &#39;      she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined\\n&#39;, &#39;      with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make\\n&#39;, &#39;      her understand his character.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she\\n&#39;, &#39;      might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but\\n&#39;, &#39;      you must remember that four evenings have also been spent\\n&#39;, &#39;      together—and four evenings may do a great deal.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that\\n&#39;, &#39;      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to\\n&#39;, &#39;      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has\\n&#39;, &#39;      been unfolded.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart;\\n&#39;, &#39;      and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had\\n&#39;, &#39;      as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his\\n&#39;, &#39;      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a\\n&#39;, &#39;      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so\\n&#39;, &#39;      well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does\\n&#39;, &#39;      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to\\n&#39;, &#39;      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of\\n&#39;, &#39;      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the\\n&#39;, &#39;      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it\\n&#39;, &#39;      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister,\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming\\n&#39;, &#39;      an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy\\n&#39;, &#39;      had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at\\n&#39;, &#39;      her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he\\n&#39;, &#39;      looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it\\n&#39;, &#39;      clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good\\n&#39;, &#39;      feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\\n&#39;, &#39;      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark\\n&#39;, &#39;      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.\\n&#39;, &#39;      Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure\\n&#39;, &#39;      of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her\\n&#39;, &#39;      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting\\n&#39;, &#39;      that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was\\n&#39;, &#39;      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly\\n&#39;, &#39;      unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable\\n&#39;, &#39;      nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance\\n&#39;, &#39;      with.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards\\n&#39;, &#39;      conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with\\n&#39;, &#39;      others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William\\n&#39;, &#39;      Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening\\n&#39;, &#39;      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I\\n&#39;, &#39;      see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do\\n&#39;, &#39;      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid\\n&#39;, &#39;      of him.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming\\n&#39;, &#39;      to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend\\n&#39;, &#39;      to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking\\n&#39;, &#39;      Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\\n&#39;, &#39;      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a\\n&#39;, &#39;      ball at Meryton?”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\\n&#39;, &#39;      energetic.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You are severe on us.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am\\n&#39;, &#39;      going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always\\n&#39;, &#39;      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my\\n&#39;, &#39;      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;\\n&#39;, &#39;      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who\\n&#39;, &#39;      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers.” On\\n&#39;, &#39;      Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she added, “Very well, if it\\n&#39;, &#39;      must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, “There\\n&#39;, &#39;      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar\\n&#39;, &#39;      with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I shall keep\\n&#39;, &#39;      mine to swell my song.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a\\n&#39;, &#39;      song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of\\n&#39;, &#39;      several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at\\n&#39;, &#39;      the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of\\n&#39;, &#39;      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge\\n&#39;, &#39;      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given\\n&#39;, &#39;      her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and\\n&#39;, &#39;      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of\\n&#39;, &#39;      excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,\\n&#39;, &#39;      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing\\n&#39;, &#39;      half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad\\n&#39;, &#39;      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the\\n&#39;, &#39;      request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases,\\n&#39;, &#39;      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end\\n&#39;, &#39;      of the room.\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\\n&#39;, &#39;      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and\\n&#39;, &#39;      was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir\\n&#39;, &#39;      William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!\\n&#39;, &#39;      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of\\n&#39;, &#39;      the first refinements of polished society.”\\n&#39;, &#39;\\n&#39;, &#39;      “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue\\n&#39;, &#39;\n*** WARNING: skipped 798621 bytes of output ***\n\n\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["--> 12.

Alice’s Evidence\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n“without pictures or conversations?”\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.\n\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope.”\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!”\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\n\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.”\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice’s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\n\n“How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!\n\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\n\n\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\ncats.”\n\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\n\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\nagain!”\n\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.\n\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 114442 bytes of output ***\n\n    For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.”\n\n\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\n\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it.”\n\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper.\n\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\nto the Knave.\n\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\n\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\n\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\n\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)\n\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.\n\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\nsentence first!”\n\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\n\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.\n\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\n\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\nhad!”\n\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\n\n\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:—\n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.\n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.\n\nTHE END \n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11-0.txt or 11-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/11/\n\nProduced by Arthur DiBianca and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Alice’s Evidence\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n“without pictures or conversations?”\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\nfrom the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\nget out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\nindeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\nletters.\n\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\ntelescope.”\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!”\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\non in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Pool of Tears\n\n\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.”\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice’s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\n\n“How doth the little crocodile\n    Improve his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\n    On every golden scale!\n\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n    How neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\n\n\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high.\n\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\ncats.”\n\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\n\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\nagain!”\n\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.\n\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n\n\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 114442 bytes of output ***\n\n    For this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\n    Between yourself and me.”\n\n\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\n\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it.”\n\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper.\n\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\nto the Knave.\n\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\n\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\n\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\n\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)\n\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.\n\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\n\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\nsentence first!”\n\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\n\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.\n\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\n\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\nhad!”\n\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\n\n\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\nand this was her dream:—\n\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\nTurtle.\n\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.\n\nTHE END \n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE’S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11-0.txt or 11-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/11/\n\nProduced by Arthur DiBianca and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&#39;s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation&#39;s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["--> If you run this (even after replacing <my bucket> and <my key> with your values) on Databricks Community Edition,\nit'll fail due to Access denied.
